So there was this total sigma named <name>, who had max <adjective> rizz. One day, while <verb>ing near the <adjective> Skibidi Toilet, they found a <adjective> <noun> just vibin’.  

Being the giga-chad they were, <name> called up their bro, <another_name>, who had a PhD in <adjective> <noun>ology. “Yo, peep this,” said <name>. <another_name> replied, “Hawk tuah! That’s insane. Let’s <verb> it.”  

Suddenly, the <noun> went full Skibidi bop bop yes yes and started <verb>ing like a total NPC. <another_name> yelled, “BRO, WE’RE GONNA <verb>!” But <name>, in their sigma mindset, calmly threw a <adjective> <noun> at it.  

In the end, the <noun> turned into a <adjective> Skibidi Toilet, and they both hit the ultimate rizz victory dance. Then they grabbed some <adjective> <food> and flexed on everyone.
